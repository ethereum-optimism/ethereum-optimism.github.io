Goldfinch's flagship product, Goldfinch Prime, enables exposure to private credit funds like Ares, Apollo, KKR and more who collectively manage over $1T of private credit assets. Through the power of stablecoins, Goldfinch expands access to these funds to nearly anyone in the world, at low cost. Goldfinch focuses on providing yields generated by real-world economic activity (mostly from US companies), thus offering a more stable alternative to the often volatile DeFi space.",
